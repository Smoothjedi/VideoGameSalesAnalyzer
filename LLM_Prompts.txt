Certainly! Here are the prompts you provided during this chat:

1. "Can you change this CSV header line into a struct statement in Racket?"
2. "all of those fields are numbers except game title, platform, genre, and publisher. Could you give me string to number statements for the rest?"
3. "Can you put all these on two about equal-length lines?"
4. "Can you just put them all on one line instead?"
5. "If I have a list of lines and each line has a list of strings, how would I convert those inner lines into structs?"
6. "What if I want to skip the first line?"
7. "Ok, let's say I have a function that will take a list of strings and convert them into a game-data struct. What I want to do is apply that function to each line in the main list and get back a list of structs"
8. "What is the apply doing in this?"
9. "My function is already going to turn each line into a struct. I don't think I need to use apply in that case, do I?"
10. "How would I get input from a user in Racket?"
11. "How about if I wanted to ask up to four inputs?"
12. "Can you make me a text-based menu that gives me numeric options for these fields?"
13. "Can you add an option for 'No more filters'?"
14. "Can you add an option to make up to 3 selections from the list?"
15. "No, sorry, I meant something more like what you put in earlier with the list of inputs"
16. "If I want to check a variable is greater than 3, how would I order that?"
17. "What if I don't want an else statement?"
18. "How do I convert a list to a struct?"
19. "I have a recursive statement that should be ending a recursive loop, but it's continuing to keep looping. Is there a statement like return in C# that would immediately terminate the recursion?"
20. "Return isn't found"
21. "The first line in my function is: (unless (< number-options-count 4) filtered-list) I thought that this would end the function if number-options-count was passed a value of 4 or more"
22. "I just want the method to terminate when the value gets over three, and continue on with the rest of the method if it is three or less. I'd prefer to not have the rest of the entire function in the else clause; I was hoping I could just have the when to end it"
23. "Sorry, I do want to return a current parameter when the function ends"
24. "Again, I don't want to have the entire rest of the function in the else clause. Can I not use when to return the value I want and end the function there?"
25. "Can you make the strings in this series of displayln statements into a list of those strings?"
26. "Can you give me a map function that will displayln each item in the list?"
27. "When I run this, the strings do print, but I get this at the end. Do you know why?"
28. "I've got a struct named game-data that has several fields. In a later function, I want to filter a list of these structs based on a field name, but I'm getting unbound identifier. How do I reference that field in the function?"
29. "If I have a series of display lines I need to change. Can you change them to follow a certain pattern?"
30. "I'm changing this to use string-interpolation. Therefore I want these to change"
31. "Can you output the prompts I gave for this chat?"
